Sample data and analysis scripts for online social learning task. 

To replicate the analyses from the raw data, download everything in the Analysis folder and save locally. Edit the script so working directories refer to your local machine. 

Modelling was conducted using Matlab R2017b and we cannot guarantee that it works with other versions of MATLAB.

For computational model comparison, see folder Analysis/Modelling. 
For model comparison, run allVBA.m  
For data simulation, run simulate_data.m
